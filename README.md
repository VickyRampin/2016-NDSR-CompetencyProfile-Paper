### Summary:
This project contains the LaTex files for building the paper "What makes a digital steward?:
 A competency profile based on the National Digital Stewardship Residencies" by [Karl-Rainer Blumenthal](http://landscapelibrarian.com/), [Peggy Griesinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peggy-griesinger-413a2173), [Julia Kim](https://twitter.com/jy_kim29), [Shira Peltzman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shira-peltzman-82389114), and [Vicky Steeves](www.victoriaisteeves.com).

### Introduction:
Digital stewardship is a rapidly maturing field within library and information science. This domain engages in the active and long-term management of digital objects towards their preservation for and unencumbered access by future generations. Although this field is growing quickly, it lacks a compentancy profile for practioners that is commonplace in LIS (example: the American Library Association's [Core Compentencies of Librarianship](http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/sites/ala.org.educationcareers/files/content/careers/corecomp/corecompetences/finalcorecompstat09.pdf)). 

This study sought to fill that gap by creating a profile of the skills, responsibilities, and knowledge areas that define competency in digital stewardship, based on three key datasets: 1) literature in the field through a literature review (to define the scope of the profile), 2) NDSR project descriptions, qualitatively analyzed to get a baseline understanding of expected competencies 3) the results of a survey given to current and past NDSR residents, quantitively evaluated to illustrate competenciesâ€™ importance to professional success.

### Thanks & Acknowledgements
The authors want to thank the NDSR community for their participation and support in conducting our study, without which it would not have been possible.
